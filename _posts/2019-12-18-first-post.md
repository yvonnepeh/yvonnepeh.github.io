Life is a learning journey. I would like to recount my data science learning experiences as I embark on this exciting journey. Jotting things down will set me thinking and reflecting more about what I have learnt, which serves the intention to accelerate my learning in data science. Hopefully it will, at the same time, provide useful information for others who are embarking on the same path.

So let the journey begin!
