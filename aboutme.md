**Hi, I'm Yvonne!**

Currently, I am pursuing a Double Master's degree programme in Data Science under the EIT Digital Programme. Previously, I was a risk analyst at an international bank where I had experience with building various risk models.

Learning is a lifelong journey and I would like to share my learning journey with you!
Feel free to explore my [POSTS](https://yvonnepeh.github.io/posts/) and [PROJECTS](https://yvonnepeh.github.io/projects/). A foodie, you are able to see my food reviews at @simplyfoodaffair on Instagram!
